Live Support is a state of the art customer service application that allows users to communicate with an expert to resolve product questions or obtain help directly from the business website. When you visit a Live Support enabled website, there is a contact us (or other similar name) button that presents different departments and/or options. Upon making a selection, the website will allow you to choose a means of communication (chat, voice or video). The Live Support application is then launched automatically to provide a direct connection to the right representative.
